# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier using CNNs 🖼️

## Overview ℹ️
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Project Structure 📂
- `cifar10_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `images/`: Directory to store sample images for testing the classifier.

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running the notebook)

## Setup 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/basantadharala/cifar-10-classifier.git
   cd cifar-10-classifier
   2. installing depencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   3.	Download the CIFAR-10 dataset:
The dataset will be automatically downloaded and cached when running the notebook.
## Usage 🚀


	•	Open and execute the cifar10_classifier.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
	•	Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess data, train the CNN model, evaluate performance, and visualize results.
	•	Optionally, adjust hyperparameters, experiment with different architectures, or modify the code to suit specific requirements.

## Results 📊

	•	The trained model achieves an accuracy of [insert accuracy here] on the validation set.
	•	Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.) are computed and displayed in the notebook.
