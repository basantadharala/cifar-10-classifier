# CIFAR-10 Image Classifier using CNNs 🖼️

## Overview ℹ️
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a popular benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to train a model to accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

## Project Structure 📂
- `cifar10_classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the code.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.
- `models/`: Directory to save trained models.
- `images/`: Directory to store sample images for testing the classifier.
